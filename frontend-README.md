# Frontend Setup
To run the frontend, you must either have the VSCode Live Server extension installed or the NPM CLI tool installed.
- cd into /frontend folder
- run index.js through VSCode's Live Server extension or by running `npx live-server --cors` in the terminal.
- Either the extension or npx should automatically open the page in your browser. If it does not open, copy the link in the console into a browser. The link should look like `http://127.0.0.1:8080`
